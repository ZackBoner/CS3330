register pP {  
    # our own internal register. P_pc is its output, p_pc is its input.

	# we could add other registers to the P register bank
	# register bank should be a lower-case letter and an upper-case letter, in that order.
	
	# there are also two other signals we can optionally use:
	# "bubble_P = true" resets every register in P to its default value
	# "stall_P = true" causes P_pc not to change, ignoring p_pc's value

# "pc" is a pre-defined input to the instruction memory and is the 
# address to fetch 10 bytes from (into pre-defined output "i10bytes").

# we can define our own input/output "wires" of any number of 0<bits<=80
wire opcode:8, icode:4;

# the x[i..j] means "just the bits between i and j".  x[0..1] is the 
# low-order bit, similar to what the c code "x&1" does; "x&7" is x[0..3]
opcode = i10bytes[0..8];   # first byte read from instruction memory
icode = opcode[4..8];      # top nibble of that byte

/* we could also have done i10bytes[4..8] directly, but I wanted to
